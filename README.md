In this exercise, I first edited the License and the individual position of each arcade draw function in order to create a smiley face. I then created the same smiley face by positioning the draw functions as a difference in x and y position from the central point of the face. The draw functions were then given variables of "eye" "catch" and "smile" to make the code easier to manage. Finally, a grid of smiley faces was made using the same relative positioning coordinates and a range function every 150 pixels.
